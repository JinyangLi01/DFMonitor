# Measuring Dynamic Fairness Metrics in Data Streams

## Abstract
The increasing deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms in critical decision-making processes has raised concerns regarding their potential biases and the consequent unjust treatment of specific demographic groups. Despite the extensive studies on fairness definitions and measurement techniques to assess different facets of algorithms and datasets, current methods largely overlook the dynamic, ever-changing nature of real-world data which makes static fairness assessments insufficient. This paper introduces a novel approach for measuring dynamic group fairness metrics for classification in streaming data by applying a time decay to traditional fairness metrics to account for changes over time. We propose novel data structures and algorithms to efficiently monitor such dynamic fairness, offering a real-time, continuously evolving view of fairness. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over static methods in terms of stability, smoothness, and resistance to occasional fluctuations in the measurement results.
